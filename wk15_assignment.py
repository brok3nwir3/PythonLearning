# Week 15 - A short review assignment.

# Q1
# Bobs code should print 1, but it's currently throwing an error.
# Help Bob fix the code.

# cakes_made = 0
# def make_cake():
#   cakes_made += 1
# make_cake()
# print(cakes_made)

# Q2
# Alice needs help making a 1D and 2D array using the naive method.
# Her 1D array needs to be 4 columns in size, with each entry filled with a '1'.
# Help Alice make the 1D array.
# Print the array to make sure it looks alright.



# Q3
# Alice needs help making a 2D array using the naive method.
# Her 2D array needs to be 4x4 in size, with each entry filled with a '1'.
# Help Alice make the 2D array.
# Print the array to make sure it looks alright.



# Q4
# Using the code from Q3, attempt to set the entry at [0][0] to 2.
# Print the updated 2D array and see what the result shows.
# Can you see the problem that comes with making 2D arrays with the naive method?



# Q5
# Bob needs to create a 6x6 2D array, but wants to avoid the naive method.
# He heard of an approach called "List Comprehension."
# Bob wants to first initialize a single list, which will be the outter array of the 2D array.
# He then wants to use a nested for loop to populate the two arrays.
# You'll need to initialize a second list inside the first loop.
# Then you'll need to populate each array entry with '1', using the .append() function.
# Help Bob make his 2D array.


# Q6
# Using the code from Q5, attempt to set the entry at [0][0] to 2.
# Print the updated 2D array and see what the result shows.
# Did this style of 2D array creation fix the problem that the naive method had?



# Q7
# Read the "Explanation" section of this article:
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-using-2d-arrays-lists-the-right-way/
# See if you can explain the problem with the naive method in your own words.
