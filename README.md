# PythonLearning
##### Learn or practice Python programming with this repo!
> _...This course assumes that you have some basic computer proficiency, such as setting up a virtual machine, searching the Internet, and cloning a GitHub repo._

## Usage
Open the [Assignments](https://github.com/brok3nwir3/PythonLearning/tree/main/Assignments) folder and start answering questions (beginning at week 1). Once you've attempted each question, use the [Answer Keys](https://github.com/brok3nwir3/PythonLearning/tree/main/Answer%20Keys) folder to compare your answers against the official answers. Check the bottom of each assignment for homework or project prompts (see the [Projects](https://github.com/brok3nwir3/PythonLearning/tree/main/Projects) folder). Tests and quizzes are assigned every few weeks, and can be located in the [Quizzes & Tests](https://github.com/brok3nwir3/PythonLearning/tree/main/Quizzes%20&%20Tests) folder.

_Note: Your code might have some differences from the official answers for assignments or projects. This is normal and expected due to the many options for solving coding problems. As long as your code achieves the same end goal, it is considered correct._

## Setup
 1. Install an interactive development environment (IDE), such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). ...Psst! It's free to download/use!
 2. Install and/or update Git. If you don't know how, click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
 3. Create a folder for your GitHub projects (if you don't have one already).
 4. Inside your GitHub project folder, clone this repo.
Use this command: `git clone https://github.com/brok3nwir3/PythonLearning.git`
 6. Once you've cloned this repo, you can start working on the first assignment (wk1_assignment.py).
