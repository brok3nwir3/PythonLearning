# PythonLearning
##### Learn or practice Python programming with this repo!
> _...This course assumes that you have some basic computer proficiency, such as setting up a virtual machine, searching the Internet, and cloning a GitHub repo._

## Usage
Open the <ins>Assignments</ins> folder and start answering questions (beginning at week 1). Once you've attempted each question, use the <ins>Answer Keys</ins> folder to compare your answers against the official answers. Check the bottom of each assignment for homework or project prompts (see the <ins>Projects</ins> folder). Tests and quizzes are assigned every few weeks, and can be located in the <ins>Quizzes & Tests folder</ins>.

_Note: Your code might have some differences from the official answers for assignments or projects. This is normal and expected due to the many options for solving coding problems. As long as your code achieves the same end goal, it is considered correct._
