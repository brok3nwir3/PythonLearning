# Project 2 (100 Points)

# For this project you'll be creating three small programs using loops.
# The programs will each generate specific output.

# Program 1 Output (Right Triangle):

# *
# **
# ***
# ****

# Program 2 Output (Diamond):

#   *  
#  *** 
# *****
#  *** 
#   *  

# Program 3 Output (Upside-down Pyramid):

# 1010101
#  10101 
#   101  
#    1   

# Requirements:
# Your program should print individual characters, and not simply copy the expected output.
# Your code will use at least one loop per output, and may require more than one loop or even nested loops.
# You might also use the 'end' print() parameter in some cases.
# You should avoid using Internet solutions unless you are completely stuck.
# Your final code should include comments explaining what your program is doing during each iteration.
