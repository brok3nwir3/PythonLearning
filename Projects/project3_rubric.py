# Project 3 (100 Points)

# For Project 3 we're making three Python modules that uses APIs.
# Your finished program should load all of the modules you created.
# The modules should make use of three seperate APIs.
# Each API should have its own function within the program.
# When the program runs, the user should be able to call an individual function or all of them.
# Any API tokens/keys should be stored in an environment file.

# You may use Internet resources, but your code should NOT be a copy of someone elses work.
# This is your project, so take pride in what you've learned, and write your own code.

# You will demonstrate your finished project, once it's completed.
# You should be able to show a working module, and explain how the code works.
