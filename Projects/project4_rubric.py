# Project 4 (100 Points)

# For Project 4 we're making three Python modules that uses APIs.
# Your finished program should load all of the modules you created.
# The modules should make use of three distinct APIs.
# Each API should have its function within the program.
# When the program runs, the user should be able to select an individual function to run.
# Any API tokens/keys should be stored in an environment file.
# Bonus: Offer the user the option to call multiple functions at once.

# You may use Internet resources, but your code should NOT be a copy of someone elses work.
# This is your project, so take pride in what you've learned, and write your own code.

# You will demonstrate your finished project, once it's completed.
# You should be able to show a working module, and explain how the code works.

# Grading Rubric...
# 1) Does the program work? (60 Points)
#   a) Demo walk-through.
#   b) Do your modules load?
#   c) Do all three API calls work?
#   d) Are all API keys stored in an environment file?
# 2) Can you explain the code, and answer questions about the code? (40 Points)
#   a) Does your program have a theme? What type of APIs did you use?
#   b) What are the names of your three modules and where are they imported?
#   c) Do any of your APIs require a key? How did you pull the key data?
#   d) How did you parse the JSON data? Did you need to do any data formatting?
#   e) What type of loop/s did you use in the main program? How are they entered/exited?
# 3) Does your program have any bonus flavor? (10 Points)
#   a) Does the program include ASCII art or fun formatting?
#   b) Can the user call multiple functions at once?
#   c) Do the APIs return a variety of data, i.e. text, images, etc?
