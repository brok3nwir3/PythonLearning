# Project 5 (100 Points) - Python Inheritance Types

# The goal of this project is to learn about the five different types of Python inheritance.

# Start by reading the following article:
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-inheritance-python/

# Your task is to create several classes.
# These classes can either be all in your main file, or seperated into multiple files (bonus points).
# Next you will use your classes to demonstrate each type of inheritance.

# Scenario:
# A new database system is being set up at a university you work at.
# The database will use Python code to determine classes and create different object types.

# Classes:
# 1. An affiliate class.
# 2. A student class.
# 3. An employee class.
# 4. A professor class.
# 5. An adjunct class.
# 6. A student_worker class.
# 7. An alumni class.

# Inheritance:
# a. The student class demonstrates single inheritance from the affiliate class.
# b. The student_worker class demonstrates multiple inheritance from the employee class and student class.
# c. The adjunct class demonstrates multilevel inheritance from the affiliate, employee, and projessor classes.
# d. The affiliate class demonstrates hierarchical inheritance with students, employees, and alumni classes.
# d. All of the classes together will demonstrate hybrid inheritance.

# Other requirements:
# i. At least one object should be created for each class.
# ii. Each class should have at least one property.
# iii. Create two functions. These can be in one or more classes.
