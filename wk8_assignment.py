# Week 8 - Exploring the OS module and continuing string manipulation.

# Hint: This website will be useful for some of the questions...
# https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-string-manipulation-handbook

# Q1
# Write a single line of code that replaces all instances of “dog” in the following sentence variable, with “seagull” instead.

sentence = 'dogs are super cool and dogs are the best animal.'


# Q2
# Alices' team is only allowed to have comments in their code that are
# A maximum of 50 characters long.
# Help Alice convert her long comment into a comment that spans more lines,
# doesn't break the 60 character limit, and doesn't use the ‘#' character.
# Alice's comment...

# My name is Alice. I wrote this program in the year 2023, while I worked at Seagull Inc. My program checks a long list of awesome animals and gives them a score, based on how awesome they are.


# Q3
# Bob needs to reformat a crazy string that he received from a new system.
# Help Bob write a program that prints a cleaned up version of the variable.
# The program should convert all upper case letters to lowercase,
# remove all hyphens, and split the string whenever a period appears.
# Bonus: Have the program print each of the final words. 

crazyString = 'e-R-Ror.oU-tp-Ut.i-s.O-F-T-en.diF-Fi-cult.T-O.rea-D.Wi-tHouT.ReFo-rMA-ttIn-G'


# Q4
# Alice learned about the OS module, which allows a Python program to execute
# Linux OS commands. Help Alice use the OS library to create
# a program that returns output similar to the following when run…
# “The current user is: X”
# “The working directory is: Y”
# Bonus: Have the output on two lines (like the example above^), instead of four.


# Q5
# Bob needs some help writing a program to clean up data.
# The program should iterate through his list of variables.
# Whenever the program encounters the string ‘ake' it should
# be removed from the entry. And whenever the program
# encounters the letter ‘w' or ‘t' it should be removed.

item1 = 'He finished playing without a single mistake.'
item2 = 'For the sake of Jake we started clapping.'
item3 = 'She was waiting on the god forsaken island.'
bobs_list = [item1, item2, item3]


# Q6
# Bob's boss is obsessed with the letter ‘z'
# Bob's boss wants him to write a program that counts the number of z's
# in a given string. He provided a test string with five z's...

testString = 'Zebras ZOOM in zig-zag patterns to escape lions with zeal.'


# Q7
# Using your knowledge of the OS module, help Alice make a loading animation.
# With the clear screen command, you can rapidly reset terminal output.
# Write three print statements with three separate animations.
# These animations will flow into each other...
# Next, write a loop that runs 15 times.
# Have your loop iterate through the three animations.
# After each animation is printed, used the clear command.
# Note: You may need to add a delay between each animation, or add more iterations to the loop.


# HW
# Bob received several more files that need formatting.
# All of the file names have the string “whisker” in them.
# Using your knowledge of the OS library…
# Help Bob write a program that will check the current directory
# for any files that contain “whisker” in the name
# and print them to the terminal.
# Bonus:
# Instead, for each file that matches, the file name should be added to a list.
# Lastly, the list should be printed as the output of Bob's program.
