# Week 13 - Iterators, built-in functions, and exception handling.

# Q1
# Alice wrote the code below,
# but decided she wants to rewrite the code using the iter() function.
# Help Alice rewrite her code.

fruit = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruit[0])
print(fruit[1])
print(fruit[2])


# Q2
# Bob wants to simply his code as well, and wants to use the same iter() function.
# However, he also wants to use a for loop and only one print statement.
# Help Bob simplify his code.
# Bonus: How would the code be written without using the iter() function?

animal = ("llama", "seal", "wolf", "seagull", "bear", "snake", "platypus", "eagle")


# Q3
# What are some examples of iterable container objects?


# Q4
# Alice is working a video game.
# She wants to add a block of code for when the game is launched.
# The code checks if a game save file exists.
# If the file exists, the file should be opened, and a success message should print.
# If the files doesn't exist, the program should print a failure message.
# Try your program without the file, and then again with the file existing.
# The file name should be "game_save_file.txt".


# Q5
# Bob has a block of code for taking user input.
# However, he wants his code to only allow the user to enter specific characters.
# The user should only be allowed to enter "x" or "o",
# any other characters should force the user to enter new input.

#play_as = input("Will you be 'x' or 'o'?: ")


# Q6
# Alice made a little program that tells users what their age is in dog years.
# However, Bob keeps crashing the program by taking in silly words instead of numbers.
# Help Alice add exception handling to catch non-integers.
# Hint: You may also need to add fix something with Alice's input line.

#input("What is your human age?:")


# Q7
# Use the built in Python functions to complete the following...

# A) Round the given number to four decimal places:
round_me = 735.99988887


# B) Get the ASCII value of the given sentence:
ascii_me = "ÀÎìÇÊ"


# C) Use the all() function to determine if all the following list entries are True:
assortment1 = ('s', 0)


# D) Sort the following list:
assortment2 = (1, 4, 3, 2, 5)
