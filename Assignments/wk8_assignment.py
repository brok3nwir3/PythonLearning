# Week 8 - The OS module and string manipulation.

# Hint: This website will be useful for some of the questions...
# https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-string-manipulation-handbook


# Q1
# Write a single line of code that replaces all instances of “dog” in the following sentence variable, with “seagull” instead.

sentence = 'dogs are super cool and dogs are the best animal.'


# Q2
# Alices' team is only allowed to have comments in their code that are a maximum of 50 characters long.
# Help Alice convert her long comment into a comment that spans more lines,
# doesn't break the 60 character limit, and doesn't use the ‘#' character.
# Alice's comment...

# My name is Alice. I wrote this program in the year 2023, while I worked at Seagull Inc. My program checks a long list of awesome animals and gives them a score, based on how awesome they are.


# Q3
# Bob needs to reformat a crazy string that he received from a new system.
# Help Bob write a program that prints a cleaned up version of the string.
# The program should...
# A) Convert all upper case letters to lowercase.
# B) Remove all hyphens.
# C) Split the string whenever a period character is present.
# D) Print a the final string with all of the changes. 
# Bonus...
# E) Print each word in the final string on a new line.

crazyString = 'e-R-Ror.oU-tp-Ut.i-s.O-F-T-en.diF-Fi-cult.T-O.rea-D.Wi-tHouT.ReFo-rMA-ttIn-G'


# Q4
# Alice learned about the OS module, which allows a Python program to execute Linux OS commands.
# She found a list of commands here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_os.asp
# Help Alice use the OS library to create a program that returns output similar to the following…
# “The current user is: X”
# “The working directory is: Y”
# Bonus: Have the output on two lines (like the example above^), instead of four.



# Q5
# Bob needs some help writing a program to clean up data.
# The program should iterate through his list of string variables.
# Whenever the program encounters the letter ‘w' or ‘t' they should be removed.
# Also, the program should remove the character sequence ‘ake' whenever it appears.

item1 = 'He finished playing without a single mistake.'
item2 = 'For the sake of Jake we started clapping.'
item3 = 'She was waiting on the god forsaken island.'
bobs_list = [item1, item2, item3]


# Q6
# Bob's boss is obsessed with the letter ‘z'
# Bob's boss wants him to write a program that counts the number of z's in a given string.
# He provided a test string for Bob, which contains five z's...

testString = 'Zebras ZOOM in zig-zag patterns to escape lions with zeal.'


# Q7
# Using your knowledge of the OS module, help Alice make a loading animation.
# Write some print statements with the separate parts of the final animation.
# Using the clear screen OS command, you can rapidly reset the terminal text.
# This will make the printed animations appear to "flow" into each other...
# Next, write a loop that runs at least 15 times, repeating the animation you created.
# Lastly, Alice determined you can import the 'time' module to add delays to your program.
# For example, using time.sleep(0.25) creates a fraction of a second delay between animations.
