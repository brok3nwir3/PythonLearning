# Week 7 - Learning about functions and algorithms.

# Q1
# Help Bob turn his Hello World program into a function.
# He wants to give the function the name 'hello'.
# Once the function is built, call 'hello' to make the function run.

# some code here...
#print('Hello World!')
# some code here...

# Q2
# Alice wants to make a similar Hello World function, similar to Bobs.
# Alice wants her function to take a single parameter called 'name'.
# When the function is called, it should return the following...
# "Hello <name>!"
# She also wants the function to be called 'greetings'.


# Q3
# Create a new program that takes two user inputs.
# The first input is the users name.
# The second input is the users favorite animal.
# Both inputs should be entered by the user at run-time via command line.
# Once both values have been provided, feed the inputs to a new function.
# The function should output the following...
# "<name>'s favorite animal is <animal>."


# Q4
# Write a program that takes in a user supplied number as an input.
# The program should then feed the input to a new function.
# The function should tell the user if the number is even or odd.


# Q5
# Create a new program that makes use of two functions...
# Write a function that takes two numbers as paramters and returns the sum.
# Note, the sum function should return (not print) the sum of the two numbers.
# The program should then call the Q4 even-odd checker function,
# and supply the number returned as a parameter to the even-odd checker function.

# Q6
# Alice made a list of her favorite animals (as she does).
# Now she needs your help creating a new function that prints words to upper case.
# The function should iterate through her list.

best_animals = ["penguins", "bears", "zebras", "seagulls"]


# Q7
# Bob is learning about algorithms.
# His instructor wants him to write an algorithm for the game of Hide-and-Seek.
# Help Bob write his algorithm, one step at a time, in pseudo code.
