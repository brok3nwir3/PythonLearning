# Week 7 - Functions, Type Casting, and Algorithms.

# Q1
# Help Bob turn his Hello World program into a function.
# He wants to give the function the name 'hello'.
# Once the function is built, call 'hello' to test it.
'''
# Some code here...
print('Hello World!')
# Some code here...
'''


# Q2
# Alice wants to make a Hello World function, similar to Bobs.
# Alice wants her function to take a single parameter called 'name'.
# When the function is called, it should return the following...
# "Hello <name>!"
# She also wants the function to be called 'greetings'.


# Q3
# Create a new program that takes two user inputs.
# The first input is the users name.
# The second input is the users favorite animal.
# Note: Both inputs should be entered by the user at run-time via command line.
# Once both inputs have been provided by the user, they should be passed to a new function.
# The function should be called 'name_animal' and have the following output...
# "<name>'s favorite animal is <animal>."


# Q4
# Write a program that takes one number from a user input.
# The program should then feed the input to a new function called 'even_odd_checker'.
# The function should print a message telling the user if the number is even or odd.
# The logic within the function should also use something called "type casting."
# Casting lets you convert an input string (or another value) to a different data type.
# For example, myvar = '4' is a string that can be converted to an integer using myvar = int('4')


# Q5
# Create a new program that makes use of *two* functions...
# Write a function called 'sum_calc' that takes two numbers as paramters and returns the sum.
# The sum function should *return* (not print) the sum of the two numbers.
# Check online for examples of how to format a *return* statement, if needed.
# The program should then call the even_odd_checker function from Q4,
# passing the number returned from sum_calc as the parameter for even-odd checker.
# Note: You can call one function within a call for another function.


# Q6
# Alice made a list of her favorite animals (as she does).
# Now she needs your help creating a new function that prints words to upper case.
# She heard Python has a built-in function called .upper(), which could help.
# The function should iterate through her list.

best_animals = ["penguins", "bears", "zebras", "seagulls"]


# Q7
# Bob is learning about algorithms.
# Algorithms describe the steps taken to achieve a certain goal.
# Bobs instructor wants him to write an algorithm for the game of Hide-and-Seek.
# Help Bob write his algorithm, one step at a time, in "pseudo code."
