# Week 1 - Hello World, the print function, comments, variables, and getting acquainted to Python.

# Q1
# This is a Python Hello World Program.
# Remove the '#' character to uncomment the code.
# Then run the program in VS-Code using the play arrow button in the top right of the IDE.

# print("Hello, World!")


# Q2
# Single line comments use the '#' character.
# Multi-line comments use a set of triple quotes: '''
# Remove the comments and try running the code.
# What do you notice about the two things being printed?
'''
print(7)
print("a")
'''

# Q3 
# In Python, we set a variable by writing a name, then placing an equal sign, and then placing some value.
# Here's an example variable...

my_var = 8

# You can give a variable almost any name.
# Try renaming 'my_var' to 'example_var'.

# We can do all sorts of things with a variable.
# Uncomment this code to print the variable.

# print(example_var)


# Q4
# Variables can even have some mathematical operations inside them.
# Try modifying the variable to print the value of example_var * 2.

# print(example_var)
