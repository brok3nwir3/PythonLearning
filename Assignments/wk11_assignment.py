# Week 11 - Learning to access and edit files.

# Q1
# Alice is learning how to access files with Python.
# Write a program that will print the contents of wk11_text.txt


# Q2
# Now Alice needs your help adding each line from the text file
# to her list of best animals. Once the animals are added,
# make sure everything is there, by printing the list.

# Note: Once you've finished, you can ignore "\n" characters...
# For example, try... print(best_animals[1])

best_animals = []


# Q3
# It's best practice to close files once you're done with them.
# Add the file close function to your code.


# Q4
# Alice decided the best animals have "ea" in the name.
# Help Alice make a new list of "ea" animals, using the old list.

ea_animals = []

# Q5
# Now that Alice has her finished list,
# she wants to overwrite the existing text file.
# Write code that will overwrite the old file contents,
# then print the new contents.
# Make sure to close the file, after the opertions.


# Here's the original text file contents, in case something goes wrong...
