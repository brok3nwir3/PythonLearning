# Week 6 - A refresher on 'for' loops, the 'range' function, and the 'end' parameter.

# Q1
# What is the starting value for 'n' ?

# x = range(4)
# for n in x:
#   print(n)


# Q2
# Which numbers will be printed?
# What number will the program stop on?

# for n in range(3,8):
#   print(n)

# Q3
# What will the final value of 'n' be?
# What will the final value of 't' be?

# t = 0
# for n in range(0, 20, 5):
#     t = t + 2
# print(n)
# print(t)

# Q4
# Type out what you think the output of this program will be.
# Run the program and see if your output matches the actual output.

# for i in range(5):
# 	print(i, end=" ")

# Q5
# Bob made this program, but forgot what it does.
# Can you tell what the program does, just by looking at it?

# for i in range(3):
#     if i % 2 != 0:
#         print("", end="_")
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print("", end="0")

# Q6
# Alice created two short lists of some of her favorite adjectives and animals.
# Help Alice write a nested 'for' loop program that prints each adjective next to each animal,
# for a total of nine print statements.

# adj = ["elegant", "formidable", "majestic"]
# animals = ["penguin", "zebra", "seagull"]

# Q7
# Use a nested 'for' loop to create the following square pattern:
# * * * *
# * * * *
# * * * *
# * * * *
