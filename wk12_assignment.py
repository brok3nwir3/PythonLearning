# Week 12 - Function review, loop review, and casting variables.

# Q1
# Bob needs help creating a function for work.
# The function should take a single string as a parameter,
# then output the string reversed.


# Q2
# Alice needs help creating a function that finds
# the square root of a single paramater.
# She heard the "math" module might help.


# Q3
# Bob wants to make a function that converts a string number parameter
# to a float version of the same number. For example, the input "7"
# should output 7.0. He thinks variable casting might be helpful for this.


# Q4
# Alice needs help writing a while loop.
# Inside her while loop, she wants to continuously increment Pi (3.14) by 0.02.
# The while loop should print the output of each addition operation.
# When the original number reaches 4.0, the loop should end.


# Q5
# Bob needs help writing a special function for work.
# The function should take two integers as parameters; a start number and an end number.
# The function should then repeatedly add the start number to the next highest value.
# For example, if a user enters "1" as the start value, and "6" as the end value,
# the function should return 21 ...(1+2+3+4+5+6).


# Q6
# Alice needs a function to call, which will print the current system time.
# She's heard rumors of a module that might help.
# This functionn should not take any paramaters.
