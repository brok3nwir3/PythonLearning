# Week 21 - A hands-on review test (post-spring break), covering weeks 15-20.

# Q1
# Create a 5x5 2D array, using list comprehension.
# Populate each array entry with 'x', using the appropriate function.



# Q2
# Format the 2D array from Q1 to print as a stack of rows, rather than a single line.



# Q3
# Check out this API... https://isevenapi.xyz/
# Write a function that calls the API, but only returns the 'ad' portion of the JSON.



# Q4
# What are the three main parts of objects in Python?

# A) Value, Variable, and Type.
# B) Type, Address, and Reference Count.
# C) Value, Address, and Reference Count.
# D) Type, Value, and Reference Count.
# E) Type, Value, and Variable.

# Q5
# Using integers, write some code to show the difference between using commas vs. plus sign in Python.



# Q6
# Write a print statement that shows the usefulness of the backslash (\) command in Python. 


# Q7
# Write a print statement that calculates the working days (not total days) in a year using an f-string.



# Q8
# Edit the code from Q1 to fill all even numbered rows with 'y' and all odd numbered rows with 'x'.



# Q9
# Create a class called 'Car'.
# The class should include make and model.
# Create a car_1 object using the class.
# The car should have the make 'Ford' and the model 'F-150'.
# Print the car_1 object attributes.



# Q10
# Update the code for the Car class to include a 'year' attribute.
# Add a year to car_1.
# Print all of the car_1 attributes with a single print statement. [We didn't cover this last part in class, but it should be easy to figure out.]
